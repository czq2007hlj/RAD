Type II B RAD-seq processing pipeline: raw reads through population analysis

Type II B RAD uses special restriction enzymes to excise 36b DNA "tags" distributed evenly across the genome of (theoretically) any organism.  

Here, we used the enzyme BcgI, which recognizes the site ...∇(N10)CGA(N6)TGC(N12)∇..., to digest the genome of the scleractinian coral *Acropora millepora*.  


Trimming Raw Reads

There are several schools of thought about trimming strategies.
